* There is going to be a grand total of 72,458 employees eligible to retire soon.
* Out of those 72,458 only 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program, as seen in the link below.

* Senior engineer and senior staff are the two departments that will be hit the hardest. With Senior engineering accounting for 25,916 of the retiring employees and senior staff accounting for 24,926 of the retiring employees. Therefore with them combining for 70% of the retiring employees, those two departments should be prioritized for finding new employees.
* There will be only two managers retiring. Which should not be a problem or something to worry about for the companies future. Weather you hire someone new to replace them or give a deserving employee a promotion to fill the position.

## Summary

With 72,458 roles needing to be filled and only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, it looks like a long and difficult road for Pewlett Hackard to be able to maintain the workforce they once had. With only the 1,549 mentors each mentor would have to train 46 to 47 employees each, which doesnt seem possible. Idealy a mentor would have less then 10 employees to train. The best thing Pewlett Hackard can do is act now and really start preparing for the future weather they find new ways to automate more things so they need less employees or simply find ways to work more efficiently so they need less employees.  Otherwise Pewlett Hackard might have to be okay with downsizing their workforce and working with what they can.
